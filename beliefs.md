# My beliefs

## Politits
- Propaganda is everywhere. Every news item should be questioned.
- Free-market liberal capitalism is probably not a good thing.
- Politics should be based on issues, especially on local issues.
- Political decisions should come about from expert debate.
- Pluralism of opinion is a good thing.
- Ideologies are in general detrimental to political discussion.

### Hungary
- Budapest must abandon the plans of the 2028 Olympics. No exceptions.
- There is a feudalism forming in Hungary. That process should be stopped.
- Likening Orbán to Hitler etc is silly.
- Orbán means well, but he is disconnected from reality.

### EU
- The European Union is a Good Thing, and unprecedented in every way.
- Europe includes everything that was ever part of the Roman Empire, and also the areas defined by the classical geographical definition. The EU has a responsibility for the welfare these areas.
- The EU should continue to develop into a technocracy governed by experts.
- The population of the EU should realise that the EU is a good thing.
- The core ethics of the EU bind us to welcome immigrants. If the immigration destroys the EU, so be it, better than leave the core ehtics.

### World politics
- The presidency of Trump is probably a good thing, because it may shake up the political establishment. It may also be a very unpleasant thing.
- The jihad must be stopped.
- Populism is bad, because the wide public has a bad taste.
- Classical liberal democracy is dead, and we should not be sorry to see it go.
- Liberalism has become its own caricature.
- Liberalism becoming a swear word is bad, because there were a lot of good ideas in there.
- Putinist propaganda is a danger to the ideals I hold dear.
- Putin may not be the satan, but should be kept at arm's length.

## Environment
- Global warming is real. Anybody denying it is a crackpot or lies. No exceptions.
- Cars are evil. Sometimes neccessary evil, but still.
- We should all recycle.
- GMO is not evil or in itself harmful. It may be harmful in the hands of free-market capitalism.

## Health
- Being healthy in body and mind may come about from a lot of exercise, and eating healthy-ish.
- I'm not sure what "eating healthy" is.
- Sugar is not poison. But eating lots of refined sugar is bad.
- "Paleo diet" is probably bullshit, but may have an incidental grain of truth. Ha, "grain".
- Homeopathy is bullshit.

## Technology
- Most of our technology is crap, because we are incompetent.
- Hardware is usually better than software.
- Loss of privacy is lamentable but inevitable, and we should enjoy the benefits.
- But one should take reasonable steps to protect the privacy of others.

## Spirituality & religion
- There is no god.
- Seemingly supernatural things that cannot be explained by reason happen, but that's just because we don't have the science to explain it. We may never have the science to explain it. Calling them "supernatural" is as good as anything.
- Religion is often dangerous, but can also be a stabilizing force in a society.
- Banning a belief system will not prevent its spread.
- Education is the only force against superstition and fundamentalism.
- Educating children about religion is actually good.
- Astrology, numerology, etc are stupid superstition.
- The Myers-Briggs test, and other similar things, may be useful for getting to know ourselves.

## Human relationships
- There are people you have an immediately obvious connection with. That connection never dies, and should be cherished.
- One should be honest and open with others. 
- Gloating over the misfortune of others is abominable. Smugness is deplorable.

## Love
- Soulmates exists, but it's often unlike how it's pictured in books.
- Marriage is a social contract protecting the woman caring for a child. 
- Relationships are supposed to be about staying with each others even in bad times.
- A loveless relationship looks useless to me, and should be ended even if it's comfy. Dunno what if there are kids, really dunno.
- There's an asymmetry in all relationships.

## Us vs the world
- We percieve the world through imperfect, biased models we maintain in our mind.
- It is possible to change that model with effort.
- Consciousness of this process, and consciousness in life in general, is the way forward.
- One has no higher purpose in life, but it may be beneficial to imagine one.

## Beliefs
- Some of my beliefs will be proven wrong.
- I'm willing to be convinced that my beliefs are wrong.
- Making and maintaining this list is useful and fun (and you should do it too).
