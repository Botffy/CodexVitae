# My beliefs

## Politits
- Free-market liberal capitalism is probably not a good thing.
- Propaganda is everywhere, but mostly unconscious. News items should be questioned or ignored, but it is good to keep track of the general sentiment.
- Politics should be based on issues.
- Political decisions should come about from expert debate.
- Pluralism of opinion is a good thing.
- Ideologies are in general detrimental to political discussion.

### Hungary
- The feudalism in Hungary is eternal, and cannot be changed.
- The political structure of Hungary is the result of being wedged between the Balkans and Germany.
- We must still hold up to our values even in the face of adversity, and we should oppose the country's slide into dictatorship.
- If we have the means, we should contribute to building the Second State, a parallel infrastructure.
- Likening Orbán to Hitler etc is silly.
- Orbán does not mean well.
- Mészáros is Orbán.

### EU
- The European Union is a Good Thing, and unprecedented in every way.
- Europe includes everything that was ever part of the Roman Empire, and also includes the areas defined by the geographical definition. The EU has a responsibility for the welfare these areas.
- The population of the EU should realise that the EU is a good thing.
- We must realize and understand why people dislike the immigration and the woke thinking, and we must recognize their problems.

### World politics
- The presidency of Trump is probably a good thing, because it shakes up the political establishment. It is also be a very unpleasant thing.
- The jihad must be stopped. Fundamentalism in general should be eradicated.
- Populism is bad, because the wide public has a bad taste.
- Classical representative liberal democracy is dead, and we should not be sorry to see it go.
- Liberalism has become its own caricature.
- Liberalism becoming a swear word is bad, because there were a lot of good ideas in there.
- Putinist propaganda is a danger to the ideals I hold dear.
- Putin may not be the satan, but he should be opposed.

## Environment
- Global warming is real, and it is caused by human activities. Anybody denying it is a crackpot or lies. No exceptions.
- Global warming is our third world war. 
- Nuclear power is the way to go, and not the renewable sources of power.
- It may be possible to solve the problem, but it needs commitment and heavy state intervention.
- This would mean changing many aspects of free-market capitalism.
- Personal efforts are commendable, but are not in itself enough.
- Urging people to flush the toilet with used bathwater etc is silly.
- GMO is not evil or in itself harmful. It may be harmful in the hands of free-market capitalism.

## Health
- Being healthy in body and mind may come about from exercise, and eating healthy-ish.
- I'm not sure what "eating healthy" is.
- Eating less meat and more vegetables is good for you.
- Eating less in general is good for you.
- Eating small portions multiple times is better for you.
- As you get older, your metabolism gets worse.
- Sugar is not poison. But eating lots of refined sugar is definitely bad.
- "Paleo diet" is probably bullshit, but may have an incidental grain of truth. Ha, "grain".
- Most silver bullet diets are probably bullshit.
- Homeopathy is bullshit.
- Healthy expensive bread makes you feel better than crap breads.

## Technology
- Most of our technology is crap, because we are incompetent.
- Hardware is usually better than software.
- Loss of privacy to Google etc is lamentable but inevitable, and we should enjoy the benefits.
- But one should take reasonable steps to protect the privacy of others.

## Spirituality & religion
- There is no god.
- Seemingly supernatural things that cannot be explained do happen, but that's just because we don't have the science to explain them. We may never have the science to explain them. Calling them "supernatural" is as good as anything.
- Religion is often dangerous, but can also be a stabilizing force in a society.
- Banning a belief system will help it spread.
- Education is the only force against superstition and fundamentalism.
- Educating children about religion is a good thing. 
- Astrology, numerology, etc are stupid superstitions, but may be useful for self-reflection.
- The Myers-Briggs test, the enneagram, and other similar things, may be useful for self-reflection.
- Spiritualist leaders are crackpots out for self-gratification and money.

## Human relationships
- There are people you have an immediately obvious connection with. That connection never dies, and should be cherished.
- One should be honest and open with others. 
- Gloating over the misfortune of others is abominable. Smugness is deplorable.
- If your happiness depends on someone else, you're doing something wrong.
- All human interactions are based on unspoken contracts. Tension is created when our respective perceptions of the contract are different. Openness, honesty, and continuous feedback may help with this.
- "Hell is other people."
- We make waves.

## Love
- There's an asymmetry in all relationships.
- Soulmates exists, but it's often unlike how it's pictured in books.
- Marriage is a social contract protecting the woman caring for a child.
- Everything that happens in a relationship is the responsibility of two people.
- Relationships are supposed to be about supporting each other even in bad times. What are the limits of this?
- A loveless relationship looks useless to me, and should be ended even if it's comfy. Dunno what if there are kids, or when one party is disabled etc, really dunno. What are the limits? When are you allowed to leave an unhappy relationship?
- You are responsible for someone you love, but the loss of love may mean the end of the responsibility.
- People in love behave like teenagers, but that is not bad. That's what being in love looks like.

## Lifestyle
- Change is a Good Thing, even when not comfy.
- Getting new perspectives is a Good Thing.
- Learning anything is a Good Thing.
- Pursuing happiness may well turn one into an asshole.
- Keeping track of things is a Good Thing.

## Us vs the world
- We percieve the world through imperfect, biased models we maintain in our minds.
- We maintain multiple such models, arranged spatially (that's a quote from Philip Dick, and should not be taken seriously. I don't care how it's arranged).
- It is possible to change that model, but it requires effort.
- Consciousness of this process, and consciousness in life in general, is the way forward.
- We do not have a higher purpose in life, but it may be beneficial to imagine one.
- When our mental models are not in sync, we experience tension and pain.
- Happy people have their mental models aligned. They may be blind to a lot of things.
- The mental models are actually narratives.

## Beliefs
- Some of my beliefs will be proven wrong.
- I'm willing to be convinced that my beliefs are wrong.
- Making and maintaining this list is useful and fun (and you should do it too).
