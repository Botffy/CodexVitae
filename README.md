My Codex Vitae.

I stole the idea from [Buster Benson](http://busterbenson.com/#what-is-this). I stumbled on his Codex Vitae by accident (when I was looking for a diary app (and found his 750words.com, which I may or may not end up trying)), and I immediately got very enthusiastic! Hyped, I proceeded to type up my [beliefs](beliefs.md). MORE MAY COME.

I don't really think anybody is going to read this, but if you do, feel free to leave comments or whatever.
