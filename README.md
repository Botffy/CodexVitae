This is my Codex Vitae, a summation of my life, a manual for me, by me.

- On the [Beliefs](beliefs.md) page you'll find my beliefs about life, the universe, and everything. I shall revise it every year, so as to keep it current. It is good to say these things out loud. I stole the idea from [Buster Benson](https://busterbenson.com/blog/2012/11-28-codex-vitae/).
- On the [My Life In Weeks](weeks.html) page you'll find, well, my life in weeks. A timeline, it features important life events, and I shall update it weekly by indicating the general evaluation of the past week. It's a nice way to do weekly self-reflection. I stole the idea from [Tim Urban](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html).
